    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Joshua E Mannhalt, I'm born and raised in Seattle WA. I currently work in Everett as a Production Illustrator.</p>
    <p>I love reading, playing table or video games.</p>
    <p>We have a communal dog at our house, and her name is Kashu the Corgi. She is very sweet and loves to run and jump</p>
    <p>I still play Pokemon Go, but I haven't reached level 40 quite yet. Hoping to soon though.</p>
